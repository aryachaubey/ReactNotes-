SO In this file we are going to discuss about state 

: So basically State is a temporary data that every Component has .
  : So State is data of a component which is being changed when there is a change in the UI , or basically it just rerenders.


 Note  : States are using hanlder functions which are maintained under events so basically event handeling.

   (I) a state belongs or is managed within a Component .
   (II) Variables are declared inside components.

   (V) this.state - Class Components.


     PROP :

  (I) A prop is something which is passed as an argument.
  (II) props are immutable.
  (III) Function parameters.
  (IV) props - functional Component
  (V) this.props - Class Components.
