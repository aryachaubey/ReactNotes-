 Component Life Cycle  : 

Whenever we create a Component it passes through various phases or stages during its life cycle 

 So In this Document we are goin to discuss about the Life cycle stages of  a Class Component only not a Functional Component.

Life cycle methods  : 

   It can be  classified into 4 phases  : 

 (i) Mounting : When an instance of a Component is being created and inserted into the DOM.
 (ii) Updating : When a component is being re-rendered as a result of change to either its props or state.

 (iii) Unmounting : When a Component is being removed from the DOM.
 (iv) Erorr Handling : When there is an Error during rendering , in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child Component.
