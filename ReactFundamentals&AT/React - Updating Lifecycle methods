Updating Lifecycle methods : 

  These methods are called or invoked when our component gets rerendered because changes in either state or 
  props: 

  There are 5 methods from which 3 falls under the category of rarely used methods : 

    Order : 

  -> static getDerivedStateFromProps()
     : This method is called every time a component is re-rendered

  -> shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)
     : It dictates if the component should re-render or not.
     : this method is surely used for performance optimization
  -> render()

  -> getSnapBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) : 
      : This method is called right before the changes from the virtual DOM are to be reflected in the DOM
      : It capture some information from the DOM.

   -> componentDidUpdate(prevProps , prevState , snapshot ) : 
       : It is called after the render is finished in the re-render cycles
       : Cause side effects.



Unmounting Phase method : 

These methods are called right after a component is unmounted or destroyed 
  - > It has only One function :
   --- componentWillUnmount()  


Error Handling Phase Methods : 

 these methods are called when there is an error either during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.
 
   -> static getDerivedStateFromError  (error)
   -> componentDidCatch (error, info)
