Refs are a function provided by React to access the DOM element and the React elements created in components. 
They are used in cases where we want to change the value of a child component,
without making use of props and state.


Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.In the typical React dataflow, 
props are the only way that parent components interact with their children. 
To modify a child, you re-render it with new props.

There are three ways to use Refs in React  : 

 (I)create.Ref() method
 (II) Using Callback Refs
