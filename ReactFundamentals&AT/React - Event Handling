Every web application has user interfaces with which the human interacts , 

  which is marked through some events in the applicatin , which can be any event like oClick event , onHover , onPress and many more,

whenver these event occurs in the web application which is the consequence of a user interaction then something happens or we can say some changes happens to the UI which is 
 which we devs have to decide that what should be the reaction of these events .



 Now As we talk about the convention of events in React . it does not uses a naming convention of lowercase , but it uses 
 the convention of camelCase.

ex - onClick , onHover , onPress , onSwipe etc.



 onClick = { clickHandler } 

 where clickHandler is an handler function and it will simply handle the click event .


>>> One silly mistake we dev do is that we add() to the handler functions of the event handlers but that we should avoid 


 .. because if we do it we will just call itself on its own without even clicking the event as soon as the interpreter reads that line.
