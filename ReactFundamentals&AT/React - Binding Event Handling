If we console.log the value of this then we will get undefined 

 because the value of  (this) in a Class Component is undefined and to solve this problem we have to simply bind the event handlers 


way to bind in Class Components is to simply use the .bind(this) method with the this.handlerFunction 

like this.handlerFunction.bind(this)

another wayto do binding is using the arrow function 


<button  on click = {()=> this.handlerFunction()}>Click me <button/>
