We are going to discuss about keys in a list :

A key is simply a prop in the list component which will alwyas have a unique value which can anything ,

One more thing about key is that it cannot be called inside the child Component that means it cannot be passed as a prop to the 
 child component.


why keys ? 

 Keys plays a major role for making the react understand that which new elements are being added to the list , removed and what has been modified in the UI 
 to smoothly keep track of the UI changes.


 Note : If keys are not there in the list then React will end up alter the UI without actually getting the appropriate access to order of children or list elements .


Key : A key is a special string attribute you need to include when you're creating a list .
