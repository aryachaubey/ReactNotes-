JSX :

-JSX is a javaScript extension that looks pretty much similar to an HTML syntax and is used inside a Component : 
-It is used to create tags , attributes and children. 
-JSX makes it easier to write simpler code in React.
-We can create React applications without JSX also .
-JSX is ultimately transpiles into javascript code which is then understood by the Browsers.


 To create a element without using JSX , we use the createReactElement method from the React Library: 


 a createReactElement usually take 3 parameters where the first parameter is the h1 tag , second parameter is the object of attributes and 
 third parameter is a text element and here in the place of the third parameter we have created a new h1 element using the createElement method.

React.createElement('div',null,createElement('h1','null,'Hello World')
