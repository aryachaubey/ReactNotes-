Destructuring  : It is an ES6 feature that makes it possible to unpack values from an array or properties from ojects into 
                distinct variables .


two ways of destructuring props 

1.  ({name , heroName } )  ==> we are using the props name and heroName from the props object and destructuring them to use them directly

 2. like this    const {name,heroName } = props

Now also we can use it directly  

 and In Class componets it will become like 

  :  const {namem, heroName } = this.props
