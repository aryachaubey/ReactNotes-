  Styling React Components  :

   1. CSS stylesheets 
   2. Inline Styling 
   3. CSS Modules
   4. CSS in JS libraries (styled Components )


Note :  When we are applying css stylesheets directly then they are applied to the child component also 
        but when we are applying CSS modules then it does not apply to the child component hence CSS modules provides better CSS structuring .
