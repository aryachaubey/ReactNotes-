 whenever we want to change the state inside a Componet  :

      We want to change the value of state and also want it to reflect into the UI ,

   if we just directly change or make modification in the state the changes will not be reflected in the UI , but if we 
     want the changes to be seen on the UI we simply use the 

    setState() method in which if we using a Class Component 

       the syntax will go like this  :

        setState () { 

           this.setState { 

             count  : this.state.count +1 

             }

          }
    Here  Count is a property of the object that we have created inside the constructor while specifying the state  





     Note :  The state is asynchrnous that means if we are specifying anything after changing the state , then that thing will be called before the state is actually changed , 


        To solve this problem  we have the setState method which have two parametres , where first one is the object and the second one is the  callback function using which we can do ou task .
