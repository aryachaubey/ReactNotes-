Hi , In this file we are going to discuss about Components  : 

 So, In the Introduction file we have discussed about a technical aspect of React which is Called a Component-Based Architecture 
 and also how we have divided our App Component into 4 Different components which were header , footer , main-content and the side-nav 
 in any traditional React appliction .

So these Components are basically divisions of our application into different blocks that we can code and modify according to ourselves.
In other words, Components are blocks that contains there specific amount of styling and other things like their own state and data.

Components are basically javascript function whose name starts with a Capital letter .

there are two types of functions : 

 (i) Stateless Component : this is basically a javaScript function 

    function Hello () { 

      return (
        <h1>Hello World<h1>
        );
      }
   
 (ii) Stateful Functional Component : this type of function renders the html using the render method.

    function 



  note  :  Every Component returns a JSX sytanx which is an extension of javaScript with a syntax very much like of an HTML .

            above , anywhere we have used a HTML in this document inside the Componet , It is basically JSX Only .
