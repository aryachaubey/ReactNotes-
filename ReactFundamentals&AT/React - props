So props are basically an object of properties which is passed as a property from the parent component to the Child Component .

Basically props were introduced to pass different values to the Same Component which is being more than 2 times , and every prop will have a different value for that Component .


You just create a Component and then you also give it a property which is known as props in React and then you take that props as 
paramter into that Child Component that you have given the property .
