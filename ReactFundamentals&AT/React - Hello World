For using React the first thing that we need to install is the node in our computer

After installing node there are two ways to create our react app 

 (I) One is using create -react-app 
 (II) Second is using the vite app

These both ways are basically a command line interface tool that allows you to instantly create and
run applications 


command to create a react project : 

 npx create-react-app name_of_prj

Here,
npx - is an npm package runner that gets installed when we install
      node into our systems.


Slightly different approach for creating a create-react -app using npm 

     :  firstly we install the create react app globally by using this command : 

                               ----> npm install create-react-app -g
                               -----> create-react-app<project_name>

these both ways can be used while we are using the create-react-app but the npx way is slightly Ez as we do not 
  have to globally install the create-react-app and then create a prj usingf it.
