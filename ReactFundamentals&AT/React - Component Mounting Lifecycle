Component Mounting Lifecycle methods  : 

These methods are called whenever an instance of component is being created and inserted in the DOM 

Order in which they are invoked : 

 -> constructor (props) : A special function that will get called whenever a new component is created.
    --  It is used for initializing state 
    --  It is also used in Binding the event handlers
Never do this in a Constructor : 
   > Do not cause side effects. Ex - HTTP requests.


One more thing to keep in mind while creating a constructor :
   > we should call the super(props) method which will inherit the property of the base class constructor.
   > Directly overwrite this.state.


-> static getDerivedStateFromProps (props, state ) 

   :  This method is  considered as a rarely used lifecycle method by the react-documentation.
      -- This method is used when the state of the component depends on changes in props over time.


-> render() : 

 It is only a required method in the Class Component .
 It read props and state and return JSX
 Should not do : Do not Change state or interact with DOM or make ajax calls.

-> ComponentDidMount() : 

 This ComponentDidMount is called only once in a Component Lifecycle and it is invoked right after a component and all its children components have been rendered to the DOM.

-- This method is a perfect place to cause side effects . Ex - Interact with the DOM or perform any ajax calls to load data.
