In every web application we might have seen that there is a list of items 

and we achieve the rendering of list by repetaively rendering the same Component with different values 

and we do this using a map() method that takes a function as its argument 

and 

arr.map( x => x*2 ) 

here x is the element of array for which each element of the array arr will be placed and the operation will be performed on it hance it 
 will then return a brand new array with modidifications made to each element of the previous array arr
