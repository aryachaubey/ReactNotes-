Fragments : 
 In React , Fragments lets you group a list of childrens  without adding extra node to the DOM.

 we know about React that if we are wishing to render multiple child elements or a group of child elements then we must encolse them inside a single parent component, 
but for doing that if we use a div tag or a div elemnt it will just simply add another node into the HTML DOM tree 

to prevent that we can use Fragments 

  <React.Fragment>
    <h1>Hii<h2>
    <p> This is nothing </p>
  </React.Fragment>
