In this file we are going to discuss about Forms and Form Handking , 

SO Basically Forms are the UI element in any website that take input from the user and stores that data somewhere , and in React that 
somewhere is nowhere but states .

 When we want to control or handle the Forms using the React then we call it a Controlled Component .

 or In other Words we do modification or control the Form using the Controlled Componenet approach.
