  ----> Why react is a good choice

 technical aspect : It has a Component- Based Architecture

A traditional website can be broken down into 4 main components - 

 (I) Header
 (II) Side-Nav
 (III) Main Content 
 (IV) Footer

Components offers the functionality of Reusable Code.

for example -  We are creating a notice component in react then we can use the 
               same component in Angular and Vue by passing the right data .


--> React is declarative :

declarative means we just have to tell what to do to the langauge and not how to do it .

 and when we tell how to do it we call it imparartive paradigm .

--> React will handle efficiently updating and rendering the components 

--> DOM updates are handled gracefully in React.
