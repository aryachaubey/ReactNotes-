We are using the Axios library for making HTTP request in React .

 The best location to put the get request in a React file is in the ComponentdidMount() method which executes only once when the 
 Component is being created, 
 Hence it is the best place for using the get method.

For doing so -  we will invoke the get method with the axios librarry putting inside the url from the address bar of the data that we want to 
                fetch  from the server.

  :  axios.get(' ')


How to access this fectched data :  As we know that axios is a promise-based library , so we will be using then and catch keywords in order 
                                    to access the fetched data into the render method of the class Componet.
