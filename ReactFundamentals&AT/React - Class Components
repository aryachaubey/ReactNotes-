Class Components are basically an ES6 syntax for creating Componets  : 

syntax  : 


import React , {Component} from 'react' ; 

Class App Extends Component { 

  render() { 

     return (
       <h1>Hello World <h1>
       ):
    }
  }

when we are creating  a class Component , we need two imports : 

   (i) import React , {Component} from 'react';




   Functional Vs Class Components  : 

    Functional Components : 

    (i) Use Functional Components as much as possible : 
    (ii) Absence of this keyword . 
    (iii) Solution without using state.  
    (iv) Stateless / Dumb / Presentational .



     Class Components  : 

     (i) More feature rich 
     (ii) Maintain their own private data - state 
     (iii) Complex UI logic 
     (iv) Provide lifecycle hooks. 
     (v) Stateful / Smart / Container. 




 One update has been made : 
 In year 2018 , React has made an official announcement about proposing a new feature which is called as Hooks that allows 
 us to use states and other React Features without having the use of Classes.


So , Basically Hooks allows Functional Components to use state and other features of React.
